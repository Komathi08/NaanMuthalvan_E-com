## Purpose
- Our e-commerce platform aims to create an exceptional online shopping experience for our customers, encompassing a wide range of features and capabilities designed to meet the needs of both customers and administrators.
- An e-commerce website allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. It facilitates order processing, payment acceptance, shipping and logistics management, and customer service.

- *Database Management System (DBMS):* MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or any other relational or NoSQL database for storing event data.
- *Programming Languages:* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for front-end development. Backend: Node.js (with Express.js), Python (with Django or Flask), Ruby (with Ruby on Rails), or any other suitable backend language/framework.
- *Version Control:* Git for version control, with a hosting service like GitHub or GitLab for collaborative development.
- *Front-end Framework:* React, Angular, or Vue.js for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- *Authentication and Authorization:* Authentication library or service (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for user registration, login, and access control.

## Hardware Requirement
- *Server:* A dedicated server or cloud-based virtual machine with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage.
- *Storage:* Adequate storage capacity to handle database operations and store uploaded files (images, documents, etc.).

## Functional Requirement
- *User Registration and Authentication:* Users should log in securely using email/password or social media accounts. The system should support password recovery and account management.
- *Product Catalog:* Display products with details, including images, descriptions, prices, and availability. Allow users to filter and search for products by category, price range, brand, and other criteria.
- *Shopping Cart and Checkout:* Allow users to add and remove items from their shopping carts. Calculate and display the total order cost, including taxes and shipping fees.
